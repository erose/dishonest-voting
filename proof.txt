Everyone voting dishonestly.

Example #1

1/2 think it's a 7
1/2 think it's a 9

[0, 7)  --> everyone votes 10, moves +
[7, 9)  --> 1/2 vote 0, 1/2 vote 10, average vote is 5, moves -
[9, 10) --> everyone votes 0, moves -

We end up at 7.

Example #2

1/3 think it's a 3.
1/3 think it's a 6.
1/3 think it's a 7.

[0, 3)  --> everyone votes 10, moves +
[3, 6)  --> 1/3 vote 0, 2/3 vote 10, moves +
[6, 7)  --> 2/3 vote 0, 1/3 vote 10, moves -
[7, 10] --> everyone votes 0, moves -

We end up at 6.

Example #3

1/6 think it's a 3.
1/6 think it's a 6.
4/6 think it's a 7.

[0, 3)  --> everyone votes 10, moves +
[3, 6)  --> 1/6 vote 0, 5/6 vote 10, moves +
[6, 7)  --> 2/6 vote 0, 4/6 vote 0, moves +
[7, 10] --> everyone votes 0, moves -

We end up at 7.

Definition: Let f(x) be the proportion of people whose rating is higher than x.
Observation: f(x) is non-decreasing.
Definition: Call an interval on which f(x) < 1/2 a "minus segment," since the average vote in this segment moves the rating downward.
Definition: Call an interval on which f(x) > 1/2 a "plus segment," since the average vote in this segment moves the rating upward.

Theorem: Let S be the first plus segment. Under dishonest voting (in any order), the rating will converge over time to the lower bound of S. It doesn't depend on order and it doesn't reflect the true average.
Proof: Since f(x) is non-decreasing, we have some number of minus segments followed by some number of plus segments. (We can't have -+-+ or something like that.) Since on average you move down when you're in the minus segments and up when you're in the plus segments, you'll end up at the lower bound of the first minus segment.

I claim that, by increasing the number of votes n, you can get within an arbitrarily small distance of the special end point discussed above with arbitrarily high probability.

Suppose you're at some point. Wait k steps. Let p be the probability of you being at least epsilon (e.g. 0.1) rating points closer to the point of convergence than you are now*. The Theorem I gave above argues that, as I increase k, this probability goes up. After you've moved to the closer spot, wait k more steps. Repeat this t times to get probability p^t that, after kt steps, you're t*epsilon closer to the convergence point than when you started.

With probability p^t, you'll travel t*epsilon total rating points using this method. If you start distance d away from the special end point discussed above, set t = epsilon/d. This gives you probability p^t of getting within that bound. If p is too low for you, increase k. So by setting t and k, you can get arbitrarily close with arbitrarily high probability, by increasing the number of votes. The total number of votes required will be n = tk.

This argument says nothing about the rate of convergence; it's just an upper bound.

*p varies somehow depending on what segment you start in. (It's higher if you're in a segment that is pushing you more strongly.) However, it is defined for each segment. To establish an upper bound on steps until convergence, we can take the lowest such p out of all the segments and use it in this argument.
